# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository showcases some of my favorite data science projects, demonstrating what I've learned and finding intriguing aspects of the field.

## Contents

### Data Exploratory Analysis 
I showed different visualization techniques on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult dataset.

### Classification1 
This project showed how to build decision tree model for different data sets, how to evaluate model by holdout and cross-validation techniques . Also, I 
    investigated the overfitting issue for the decision tree model.

### Classification2 
This project demontrates how to build a k-NN model for different data sets and how to determine/compare the efficiency of models. Moreover, I performed hyperparameter setting and model selection.

### Clustering1
This project shows how to apply k-means and hierarchical clustering to the dataset found in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29. I showed how to extract insights using cluster analysis results.

### Clustering2
I showed how to applying DBSCAN clustering different benchmark data sets and Compared and analyzed the results.

### Anamoly Detection in Data
I applied different anomaly detection techniques and then Compared and see the behaviour of diffrent approaches.
